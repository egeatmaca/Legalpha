0;Contract Termination - General;A formal request is the most common circumstance that leads to the termination of a lease. So-called ordinary termination is the normal way, but there is also the extraordinary termination. Especially in the case of termination, the protection of tenants has been strongly emphasized by the legislature. It is practically so that the tenant can terminate at will, provided that they adhere to the deadlines.  However, the landlord can terminate only in the presence of certain circumstances, which are enumerated in the law. Cancellations often lead to disputes. In order to avoid such disputes, parties can also conclude a termination agreement by mutual consent. For the details of the termination process, it’s also important to consider the type of the contract, such as limited, unlimited or staggered rental aggrement.
1;Contract Termination - Unlimited Contracts;Unless otherwise agreed, leases are of unlimited duration (Par. 564 II BGB).   For a tenancy of residential premises, the notice period is governed by Par. 565 II BGB: 0-5 years of tenancy: 3 months 5-8 years of tenancy: 6 months 8-10 years of tenancy: 9 months from 10 years of tenancy: 12 months  The decisive point in time for calculating the duration of the notice period is the receipt of the notice by the landlord. The notice must be received by the landlord at the latest on the 3rd working day of the month. These notice periods are valid not only for the landlord, but also for the tenant.  The agreement of longer notice periods is permissible - by AGB anyhow on 6 months (OLG Zweibruecken, WuM 1990/8). The shortening can only be in favor of the tenant, not in favor of the landlord.
2;Contract Termination - Limited Contracts;A tenancy agreement can also be concluded for a limited period of time. In case it ends with the expiration of the term, an ordinary termination is is not possible during the contract period! Only the extraordinary termination with a termination agreement remains for both sides.
3;Contract Termination - Staggered Rental Agreements;After 4 years, the tenant can terminate the contract. (Par. 10 Abs. 2 S. 6 MHG)   The notice period is governed by Par. 565 II BGB: 0-5 years of tenancy: 3 months 5-8 years of tenancy: 6 months 8-10 years of tenancy: 9 months from 10 years of tenancy: 12 months  The decisive point in time for calculating the duration of the notice period is the receipt of the notice by the landlord. The notice must be received by the landlord at the latest on the 3rd working day of the month. These notice periods are valid not only for the landlord, but also for the tenant.  The agreement of longer notice periods is permissible - by AGB anyhow on 6 months (OLG Zweibruecken, WuM 1990/8). The shortening can only be in favor of the tenant, not in favor of the landlord.
4;Contract Termination - Substitute Tenant (Nachmieter);"In rare cases, there are rental contracts with a substitute tenant (Nachmieter) clause.
Here, the contract exactly determines under which circumstances a new tenant can be provided. 

Most of the time there is no substitute tenant clause in rental agreements. Most important principle is that the landlord has no obligation to terminate the tenant's
contract prematurely, even if reasonable substitute tenants are provided. This follows from the general principle pacta sunt servanda, i.e. contracts are binding. Accordingly, it does not matter whether the tenant can use the apartment or not (Par. 552 Abs. 1 BGB)

However, there are some exceptions where the tenant has a right to terminate prematurely.

The landlord may be obliged to evict the tenant from the lease agreement prematurely in return for the provision of a suitable tenant, if there are reasons which makes ordinary termination of the lease unreasonable.
Thus, there must be two cumulative conditions:
- an important reason 
- a suitable new tenant

It is disputed whether this applies only to residential leases or also to
or also for leases of business premises."
5;Contract Termination - Substitute Tenant (Nachmieter) - Important Reasons to Terminate Contract Prematurely with a Substitute Tenant;"Examples valid reasons:
- serious illness of the tenant
- admission to a nursing home
- essential change of the family (LG Bonn WuM 1992/16, LG
Landshut WuM 1996/542, LG Oldenburg WuM 1995/394)

Examples of invalid reasons:
- in the case of moving into a cheaper, better or more convenient apartment
(Higher Regional Court Hamburg DWW 1987/71)
- for reasons of social tenancy law (OLG Hamm WuM 1995/577)

Also an exception is made for military personnel, civil servants, clergy and teachers in Par. 570 BGB. These have an extraordinary right of termination. A corresponding application to other employees is not (!) possible, i.e. a change of job change of job does not justify early termination (BayObLG ZMR 1985/199)"
6;Contract Termination - Substitute Tenant (Nachmieter) - Reasonability of the Substitute Tenant;"As a requirement, the new tenant must be reasonable for the landlord. According to their personal and economic circumstances, the new tenant must be able to guarantee the landlord is not being placed in a worse position. Furthermore, the next tenant must (at least) accept the existing terms of the contract unchanged.

The landlord can reject a new tenant for objective reasons.
The limitation on 3 refusals does not exist!

Objective reasons:
- no comparable economic security as the previous
tenant (OLG Duesseldorf, WuM 1995/391=
- the new tenant wants to use the apartment commercially (LG Giessen WM
1996/23)
- the previous tenant is in arrears with the rent payment;
the deposit is not credited in favor of the tenant (KG,
WuM 1992/8)

No objective reason:
- the substitute tenant is a foreigner (BGH MDR 1970/320)"
7;Contract Termination - Substitute Tenant (Nachmieter) - Rent Increase;According to the case law, the landlord may demand a higher rent from the replacement tenant if the previous rent is below the local comparative rent. (even if a graduated rent was agreed with the previous tenant) (OLG Hamburg, NJW-RR 1987/657, LG Saarbruecken WuM 1995/313, a.A. Sternel Mietrecht IV 351).
8;Contract Termination - Multiple Tenants;Problems arise more often with multiple tenants, when one wants to move out of the apartment, but the other does not. (most common case: an unmarried couple separates) Termination by one tenant alone is not possible! Only both of them together can declare this to the landlord. However, the tenant who wants to move out, can claim against the other tenant and may have a right to consent to the termination. Until claim is enforced and the lease is terminated, both tenants jointly owe the landlord the rent. It does not matter who lives in the apartment. This is explained by the principles of contract law: the landlord has chosen two tenants and their joint solvency on the basis of which he decided to conclude the contract. In the internal relationship, however, one tenant can claim compensation for the rent paid from the other tenant.
9;Contract Termination - Termination by Landlord;When it comes to ending leases, landlords are limited to valid reasons, meaning they can't terminate a lease solely for rent increases or selling purposes. Valid reasons encompass breach of duty, own consumption, and economic efficiency. However, exceptions exist for temporary rentals or furnished rooms where the landlord resides. In cases where tenants face extreme hardship, they have the right to object to the termination. The notice periods for lease termination vary based on the length of the tenancy, typically spanning 3, 6, or 9 months. It's crucial to adhere to all legal requirements and formalities when initiating the lease termination process.
10;Deposit - General - Where is the rental deposit regulated?;"The rules about rental deposits are outlined in Section 551 of the German Civil Code (BGB), under the heading ""Security Deposit for Rent."" Since a rental deposit is a standard security measure that can be agreed upon in any other contract as well, the general provisions of Sections 232 to 240 of the German Civil Code (BGB) also apply."
11;Deposit - General - What is the purpose of the deposit?;"The deposit serves to protect the landlord's rights. Section 551, paragraph 1, sentence 1 states that the tenant must provide security ""for the fulfillment of their obligations."" This includes all financial obligations and payments by the tenant, such as:
Outstanding rent payments, including advance payments for operating costs.
Additional payments for operating costs.
Costs incurred for repairs due to uncompleted cosmetic repairs.
Claims for damages.
Costs for legal proceedings and litigation.
Compensation for use and damages resulting from delayed move-out."
12;Deposit - General - Do you need to specifically agree to a deposit?;"Yes, you do. The obligation to provide security is not automatically required by the law; it is only limitedly mentioned there (see: How much can the deposit be?). The type and amount of the deposit must be specified in the rental agreement."
13;Deposit - Amount - How much can the deposit be?;"The deposit cannot exceed three times the monthly base rent. It's important to note that any advance payments for utilities should not be included in this calculation. If the rental includes a lump-sum payment for utilities (known as ""Warmmiete""), this should be subtracted from the total.
However, there are exceptions where the deposit can be higher:
A third party voluntarily and without request provides an additional deposit, usually to make the tenant more appealing to the landlord.
A specific, particularly expensive, or sensitive item (e.g., a new hardwood floor) is being exceptionally secured through the deposit.
Existing rental arrears need to be covered to prevent the landlord from rightfully terminating the lease.
The tenant is making the apartment more accessible (e.g., adding accessibility features), in which case they must provide additional security to cover the cost of restoring the property to its original condition."
14;Deposit - Amount - What if the deposit is too high?;"If an excessive deposit is requested, it's considered oversecurity or an ""Übersicherung"" in German. In this case, the tenant has the right to have the excess amount released. This could mean a refund of the extra money or a partial waiver of the guarantee."
15;Deposit - Amount - Does the deposit automatically increase with later rent increases? ;"No, the maximum deposit amount is calculated based on the initial base rent.
A later increase of the deposit to three times the new rent is possible, but it requires mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord for a specific rent increase.
Whether an automatic increase can be stipulated in the rental agreement is a subject of debate. An individually negotiated clause is likely to be valid. However, because the provisions in the rental agreement typically constitute general terms and conditions (AGB), they must pass AGB review. In most cases, such a clause would be considered surprising and therefore invalid.
In practice, post-rent increase deposit raises are extremely rare."
