0,"A formal request is the most common circumstance that leads to the termination of a lease. So-called ordinary termination is the normal way, but there is also the extraordinary termination. Especially in the case of termination, the protection of tenants has been strongly emphasized by the legislature. It is practically so that the tenant can terminate at will, provided that they adhere to the deadlines.  However, the landlord can terminate only in the presence of certain circumstances, which are enumerated in the law. Cancellations often lead to disputes. In order to avoid such disputes, parties can also conclude a termination agreement by mutual consent.",contract termination
1,"Unless otherwise agreed, leases are of unlimited duration (Par. 564 II BGB).   For a tenancy of residential premises, the notice period is governed by Par. 565 II BGB: 0-5 years of tenancy: 3 months 5-8 years of tenancy: 6 months 8-10 years of tenancy: 9 months from 10 years of tenancy: 12 months  The decisive point in time for calculating the duration of the notice period is the receipt of the notice by the landlord. The notice must be received by the landlord at the latest on the 3rd working day of the month. These notice periods are valid not only for the landlord, but also for the tenant.  The agreement of longer notice periods is permissible - by AGB anyhow on 6 months (OLG Zweibruecken, WuM 1990/8). The shortening can only be in favor of the tenant, not in favor of the landlord.","contract termination, unlimited contracts"
2,"A tenancy agreement can also be concluded for a limited period of time. In case it ends with the expiration of the term, an ordinary termination is is not possible during the contract period! Only the extraordinary termination with a termination agreement remains for both sides.","contract termination, limited contracts"
3,"After 4 years, the tenant can terminate the contract. (Par. 10 Abs. 2 S. 6 MHG)   The notice period is governed by Par. 565 II BGB: 0-5 years of tenancy: 3 months 5-8 years of tenancy: 6 months 8-10 years of tenancy: 9 months from 10 years of tenancy: 12 months  The decisive point in time for calculating the duration of the notice period is the receipt of the notice by the landlord. The notice must be received by the landlord at the latest on the 3rd working day of the month. These notice periods are valid not only for the landlord, but also for the tenant.  The agreement of longer notice periods is permissible - by AGB anyhow on 6 months (OLG Zweibruecken, WuM 1990/8). The shortening can only be in favor of the tenant, not in favor of the landlord.","contract termination, staggered rental agreements"
4,"In rare cases, there are rental contracts with a subtenant clause.
Here, the contract exactly determines under which circumstances a new can be provided. 

Most of the time there is no subtenant clause in rental agreements. Most important principle is that the landlord has no obligation to terminate the tenant's
tenant prematurely from the lease, even if reasonable substitute tenants are provided. This follows from the general principle pacta sunt servanda, i.e. contracts are binding. Accordingly, it does not matter whether the tenant can use the apartment or not (Par. 552 Abs. 1 BGB)

However, there are some exceptions where the tenant has a right to terminate prematurely.

The landlord may be obliged to evict the tenant from the lease agreement prematurely in return for the provision of a suitable tenant, if there are reasons which makes ordinary termination of the lease unreasonable.
Thus, there must be two cumulative conditions:
- an important reason 
- a suitable new tenant

It is disputed whether this applies only to residential leases or also to
or also for leases of business premises.","contract termination, nachmieter"
5,"Examples valid reasons:
- serious illness of the tenant
- admission to a nursing home
- essential change of the family (LG Bonn WuM 1992/16, LG
Landshut WuM 1996/542, LG Oldenburg WuM 1995/394)

Examples of invalid reasons:
- in the case of moving into a cheaper, better or more convenient apartment
(Higher Regional Court Hamburg DWW 1987/71)
- for reasons of social tenancy law (OLG Hamm WuM 1995/577)

Also an exception is made for military personnel, civil servants, clergy and teachers in Par. 570 BGB. These have an extraordinary right of termination. A corresponding application to other employees is not (!) possible, i.e. a change of job change of job does not justify early termination (BayObLG ZMR 1985/199)","contract termination, nachmieter, important reasons"
6,"As a second requirement, the new tenant must be reasonable for the landlord. According to their personal and economic circumstances, the new tenant must be able to guarantee the landlord is not being placed in a worse position. Furthermore, the next tenant must (at least) accept the existing terms of the contract unchanged.

The landlord can reject a new tenant for objective reasons.
The limitation on 3 refusals does not exist!

Objective reasons:
- no comparable economic security as the previous
tenant (OLG Duesseldorf, WuM 1995/391=
- the new tenant wants to use the apartment commercially (LG Giessen WM
1996/23)
- the previous tenant is in arrears with the rent payment;
the deposit is not credited in favor of the tenant (KG,
WuM 1992/8)

No objective reason:
- the substitute tenant is a foreigner (BGH MDR 1970/320)","contract termination, nachmieter, reasonability of tenant"
